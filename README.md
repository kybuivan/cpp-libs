# A list of open source C++ libraries

The goal of this page is to create a list of examples of open-source C++ libraries so that people don't have to search the web when they need a specific implementation for a particular functionality.

If you know of a library that might be useful to others, please add a link to it here along with illustrative examples. There are no restrictions on what can be included, except that the source code of the library must be readily available for download.

The page is provided "as is" - with the hope of being useful but without any warranties. Outdated, misleading, or incorrect links might appear here. If you notice any of these issues, it would be great if you could fix the error.
